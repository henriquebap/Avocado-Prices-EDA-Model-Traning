# Hass Avocado Prices Prediction

## **Introduction**
This project aims to analyze, forecast, and predict the prices of Hass avocados using various machine learning models. We performed extensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and employed multiple regression models to find the best predictors for future avocado prices.

## **Dataset**

The data for this project comes from the Hass Avocado Board and contains information about avocado prices and sales volume in different regions of the United States. The dataset includes both conventional and organic avocados with different Price Look-Up (PLU) codes.

## **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

### **Key Insights**

1. **Conventional Avocados**: Generally cheaper with higher sales volume. Consumers likely prefer conventional avocados due to their cost-effectiveness.
2. **Organic Avocados**: Pricier with lower sales volume. The significant price difference suggests cost concerns might drive consumer preferences.
3. **Seasonal Trends**: Sales peaks in February and May 2016, and February 2017 coincide with the lowest prices, indicating seasonal effects on demand.
4. **Regional Sales Dynamics**: Highest sales in the West and California regions, followed by South Central and North East.
5. **PLU and Bag Types**: Avocados with PLU 4046 and 4225 see higher sales and small bags are the most sold.
